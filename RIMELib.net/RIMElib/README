Functionality: used for parsing, evaluating, differentiating and
               integrating arbitrary (text based) equations.

c operation: see erime.h for details.
c++ operation: see rime.h for details.


Requirements
============

You'll need gsl (the GNU scientific library) installed - RIMElib is
built on gsl, and will not work without it.  See
http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ for information abount gsl.


Making the library
==================

Simple installation method: make
                            make clean

This should give you a library file (librime.a).  If that doesn't work,
try editing the makefile appropriately.  If all else fails, try hand
compilation:

gcc -W -Wall -c mathtext.c
gcc -W -Wall -c gvars.c
gcc -W -Wall -c gmaths.c
gcc -W -Wall -c erime.c
gxx -W -Wall -c rime.cc

ar rcvs libmaths.a mathtext.o gvars.o gmaths.o erime.o rime.o

substituting appropriately for your compiler (gcc is the C compiler, gxx
the C++ compiler, ar the library file maker whatsit).


Installing the library
======================

Once compiled, the following are the relevant files for use:

libmaths.a: the maths library file.
emaths.h:   header file for the C interface to the library (#include this
            when using the library in C).
maths.h:    header file for the C++ interface.

Basically you just need to include the relevant header in your code (as
always) and link in the libmaths library (and also the gsl library!) when
you compile / link your code.  See test.cc for an example of how to use
the library, and above for compilation instructions.

Alternatively, copy these to the appropriate places in your lib/include
tree so that they are available from all directories.

Enjoy :)


Test interface
==============

After installation, if you want to have a play with the library test
interface then type make test.  This will produce test.exe, a simple test
interface that can be used to familiarise yourself with the workings of
the library.

If make fails, try:

gxx -W -Wall test.cc -L. -lmaths -lgsl -o test.exe


To Do List
==========

- Add "no gsl" switch
- Port random number generation to gsl.
- Port random number distrib functions to gsl.
- Make all functions available in gsl available here.
- Documentation needs to be expanded / checked etc.
- Add non integral based derivatives for incomplete gamma functions.
- Need to make code ISO C90 compliant (at least to some degree, anyway), as
  at present the code may have difficulties with some compilers.  The type
  long long is the main issue here.
- Some of the string handling stuff is hacky and non-standard.
- when unrolling sum, prod and integ, be very careful with edges.
  Currently even a slight numerical weirdness will cause errors.
  Also, you might want to limit the amount of unrolling that can
  occur.  For example, sum(1,1,10,.1,...) - what if numerical
  troubles make us end at 10.001?  Also, what about
  sum(1,1,10,3,...) - this shouldn't cause an error, but at present
  it will.
  sum(1,1,10,1,sum(2,2*var(0,1),2*var(0,1)+1,1,...))
  Furthermore, a sum inside a sum will cause isError during
  simplification for reasons unknown.  This may carry over to
  product also.
- check return code for set_loc_var, restore_loc_var, touch_loc_var


temporary hacks: - have removed loop unrolling (for now).
                 ADENDUM: doing this broke differentiation, so it
                 has been temprorarily re-added as differentiation
                 is more important to me now than nested sums.
                 THIS IS A MAJOR BUG.


Known bugs
==========

- Loop unrolling is broken.  See to do list for details.  Nested summation
  unrolling is essentially completely broken.
